# OpenChain Security Assurance Specification 1.1 Self-Certification Questionnaire
## The Simple Way To Check Conformance

Revision 1\
2022-10-15

# Introduction

The OpenChain Security Assurance Specification is intended to identify and describe the key requirements of a quality Security Assurance Program in the context of using Open Source Software. It focuses on a narrow subset of primary concern: checking Open Source Software against publicly known security vulnerabilities like CVEs, GitHub/GitLab vulnerability reports, and so on.

You can adopt the OpenChain Security Assurance Specification by self-certification in your own time or working with a service provider for independent assessment or third-party certification. Our recommended path is self-certification and we provide this document to support this with a series of "yes" or "no" statements. If you can answer "yes" to everything, you are self-certified. If you answer "no" to some items, you know where to invest further time to build a quality program.

We have a lot of resources to support you if you need assistance. You can join our mailing lists, our webinars, our group calls and our regional work groups to discuss challenges with your peers and in your native language. You can get started here:

Finally, if you want direct support from the project you can email
[[info@openchainproject.org]{.underline}](mailto:info@openchainproject.org)
with questions. We provide support for free. The OpenChain Project is funded by our Platinum Members and is designed to help support the global supply chain transition to more effective and efficient open source license compliance.
