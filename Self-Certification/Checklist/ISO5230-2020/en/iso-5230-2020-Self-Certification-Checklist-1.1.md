# OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 Self-Certification Checklist
## The Simple Way To Check Conformance

Revision 1\
2022-10-05

# Introduction

OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230:2020 is the International Standard for open source license compliance. It is simple, effective and suitable for companies of all sizes in all markets. This standard is openly developed by a vibrant user community and freely available to all. It is supported by extensive reference material and official service provider partners.

You can adopt OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230:2020 by self-certification in your own time or working with a service provider for independent assessment or third-party certification. Our recommended path is self-certification and we provide this questionnaire to support this with a series of "yes" or "no" questions.

We have a lot of resources to support you if you need assistance. You can join our mailing lists, our webinars, our group calls and our regional work groups to discuss challenges with your peers and in your native language. You can get started here:

Finally, if you want direct support from the project you can email
[[info@openchainproject.org]{.underline}](mailto:info@openchainproject.org)
with questions. We provide support for free. The OpenChain Project is funded by our Platinum Members and is designed to help support the global supply chain transition to more effective and efficient open source license compliance.

## Next Steps

Have you self-certified to this specification? Please let us know by emailing [operations@openchainproject.org](mailto:operations@openchainproject.org). We would like to add your organization logo to the OpenChain website. This is optional, but very useful for our work.
