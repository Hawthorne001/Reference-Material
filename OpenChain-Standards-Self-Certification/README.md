# Official Self-Certification Questionnaire and Checklists

## Introduction

This section of our reference material is focused on providing you with our self-certification questionnaire (legacy) and our self-certification checklists. These materials are designed to allow you to quickly, easily and effectively begin using our specifications inside your organization and supply chain. 

If an organization can answer positively each question or statement, then it meets all the requirements of the relevant specification. If an organization needs to do additional tasks to answer a question or statement positively, then it knows where to focus resources.

You can get help with self-certification from our global community. Get started here:
