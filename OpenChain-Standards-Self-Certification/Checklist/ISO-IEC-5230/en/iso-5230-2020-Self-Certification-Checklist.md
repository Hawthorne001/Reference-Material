# OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 Self-Certification Checklist
## The Simple Way To Check Conformance

Generation 2 - Version 1
2025-08-18

# Introduction

OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 is the International Standard for open source license compliance. ISO/IEC 5230 helps organizations manage open source licensing requirements for past, current and future products or services.

Your organization can self-certify to conform to OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230. It is as simple as answering “yes” to all the questions on the online form. If an organization cannot answer “yes” to all of the questions, it does not yet meet the requirements of the standard.

Please note that this is a self-certification, and you and your organization are solely responsible for the accuracy of the statements below.

You also have the option of filling out this checklist online:

# Next Steps

Have you self-certified to this specification? You can let us know at this link:

We would love to add your organization to our Community of Conformance list on the OpenChain Project website. This is optional, but it is a great way to encourage adoption across the supply chain.
