## This is an overview of where to find validators for the OpenChain Telco SBOM Guide

You will find the official Validator - contributed from Nokia - on the OpenChain Telco Work Group GitHub repo here:
https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/Telco-WG/tree/main/tools/openchain_telco_sbom_validator

The OpenChain Telco SBOM Validator is the default community-supported method of checking if an SBOM meets the requirements of the OpenChain Telco SBOM Guide.

You will find alternative validator support in the SCANOSS Open Source Inventory Engine:
