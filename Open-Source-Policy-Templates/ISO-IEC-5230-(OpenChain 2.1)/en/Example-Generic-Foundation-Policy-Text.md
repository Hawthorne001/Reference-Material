| **\[FOUNDATION\] Open Source Policy** |
| **Introduction** |
| The \[FOUNDATION\] is committed to open development, and believes that free and open source software provides the best framework for both providing value for money, \[and therefore the public purse\], and also the highest quality software. |
| The \[FOUNDATION\] recognises that using open source software presents some risks (particularly in terms of the consequences of non-compliance with its license terms). By adopting appropriate policies, practices and procedures, these risks can be address and minimised. This policy is compliant with the OpenChain Specification v2.1, ISO/IEC 5230:2020, an industry standard for open source license compliance. |
| The purpose of this policy is to guide the \[FOUNDATION\] in making the best use of open source software while understanding and mitigating any risks of non compliance with license terms.  <br><br/>If you are an external contributor to projects, you are not bound by this policy, but we ask that you read it as it will help to answer any queries you may have about how we select code for incorporation into our codebase. You will, however, have to sign our \[Developer Certificate of Origin\]\[Apache-style CLA\], which you can find here \[insert link\]. |
| **Definitions** |
| "compliance artifacts" - each artifact which represents the output of the open source management program for each component of a supplied software release. This may include (but is not limited to) one or more of the following: source code, attribution notices, copyright notices, copy of licenses, modification notifications, written offers, open source component bill of materials, SPDX documents and so forth. |
| "compliance log book" - the complete set of compliance artifacts which are made available to third parties to comply with the requirements of the licenses applicable to supplied software for a specific release, in the appropriate form to ensure compliance (e.g. license text may be required, as opposed to a link to the license text). |
| "identified licenses” - a set of open source software licenses identified as a result of following an appropriate method of identifying open source components from which the supplied software is comprised. |
| "OpenChain conformant" - a program that satisfies all the requirements of the Linux Foundation's Open Chain Specification v2.1, ISO/IEC 5230:2020 |
| "open source" - software subject to one or more licenses that meet the Open Source Definition published by the Open Source Initiative (see opensource.org/osd) or the Free Software Definition published by the Free Software Foundation (see gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) or similar license. |
| "Open Source Compliance Board Member" the individual sitting on the \[board\] of \[FOUNDATION\] with overall responsibility for \[FOUNDATION's\] open source compliance program. |
| "Open Source Compliance Lead" - the individual with day-to-day responsibility for open source compliance issues within the \[FOUNDATION\] as detailed in Appendix 1 |
| "Open Source Liaison" - the individual responsible for addressing external open source compliance queries\[, and open source outreach with external projects\]. More details can be found in Appendix 1. |
| "open source log" - the record kept in \[ticketing system\] of determinations, queries and answers relating to the \[FOUNDATION\]’s selection and incorporation of open source code. |
| "program" - the set of policies, processes and personnel that comprise an organization’s open source license compliance activities. |
| "program participants" - any organization employee or contractor that defines, contributes to or has responsibility for preparing supplied software. Depending on the organization, that may include (but is not limited to) software developers, release engineers, quality engineers, product marketing and product management. It does not include external contributors to code, provided that the code in question is submitted and selected for incorporation in accordance with this policy. |
| "SPDX" - the format standard created by the Linux Foundation’s SPDX (Software Package Data Exchange) Working Group for exchanging bill of materials for a given software package, including associated license and copyright information (see spdx.org). |
| "supplied software" - software that an organization distributes to third parties (e.g., other organizations or individuals). |
| "verification materials" - materials that demonstrate that a given requirement of the OpenChain Specification v2.1, ISO/IEC 5230:2020, is satisfied. |
| **Introduction** |
| Our open source policy \[can be found at\] \[is publicly available on Github\] at \[LINK\]. |
| All joining program participants will be made aware of the open source policy, and associated training policy and its location during the induction process. This will be recorded on the \[induction checklist\]. |
| The \[FOUNDATION\]’s list of roles and corresponding responsibilities for the different program participants can be found in \[see Appendix 1 for a sample\]. |
| The \[FOUNDATION\]’s list of competencies for each role in the program can be found in \[see Appendix 1 for a sample\]. |
| All \[FOUNDATION\] program participants must undertake training covering the competencies required for their role, and at a minimum basic training. Appendix 5 contains details of the training requirements for each role. |
| Every program participant will be assessed, and records of the assessment will be retained by the \[FOUNDATION\] for \[at least 6 years\]. |
| **Overview** |
| • This open source policy is, and will remain available, at \[insert link\].  <br>• Our open source objectives are set out in the introduction to this policy.  <br>• You contribute to the effectiveness of the program by understanding the rationale behind, and content of, this policy. This includes keeping yourself up to date with our activities and practices, and also keeping up to date with current software development practices and techniques. You can do this by following news sources like \[insert sources\], participating in \[list forums, mailing lists\], and undertaking training activities. If you have any questions relating to this policy, or to our practices and procedures relating to open source, please do not hesitate to contact \[Open Source Compliance Lead - see Appendix 1\].  <br>• It is important that the \[FOUNDATION\] adheres to this policy. Failure to do so may lead to:  <br>• legal claims from the holders of copyright or other intellectual property rights in code we use;  <br>• claims from recipients of our code;  <br>• the inadvertent release of code we are not permitted to release;  <br>• breach of regulatory obligations by the \[FOUNDATION\] potentially leading to fines;  <br>• loss of reputation;  <br>• loss of funding and income;  <br>• breach of contract.  <br>For this reason, we take breaches of this policy seriously, and any individual breaching the policy may find themselves subject to disciplinary action. |
| The \[FOUNDATION\]’s training and assessment program will cover the objectives of each program in which you participate, your role within the program, and implications to the \[FOUNDATION\] and to individuals for non-conformance. Evidence of your assessment will be retained by the \[FOUNDATION\] \[in line with the \[FOUNDATION\]’s HR data retention/destruction policy\]. |
| **Program scope** |
| The Open Source Compliance Lead will consider at the initiation of any new project within the \[FOUNDATION\] whether that project should also be included within the scope of the program, and if so, that proposal shall be made to the \[Board Members\] through the Open Source Compliance Board Member and if the proposal is adopted, the scope of the program, and if necessary, this policy, will be amended accordingly. The Open Source Compliance Lead may also initiate a review of the scope of the program at any time they consider it appropriate to do so, following the same process. |
| This open source policy covers projects developed under the \[FOUNDATION\]’s program. \[In future, the \[FOUNDATION\] may determine that different products and projects are part of different programs, and each program may have a different scope.\] |
| **License Review and Obligations** |
| Our procedure for reviewing and documenting the obligations, restrictions and rights granted by each identified license is as follows:  <br>• \[Open Source Compliance Lead\] makes a preliminary assessment of the license based on the criteria set out in \[Appendix 2\].  <br>• In case of any doubt, \[Open Source Compliance Lead\] refers the question to \[External Legal Counsel\]\[whose details are in Appendix 1\].  <br>• The outcome of any determination, and associated rationale (whether internal or external) is recorded in the open source log. |
| **External Liaison** |
| Details of our Open Source Liaison can be found at \[link to externally facing website\]. Further details of our Open Source Liaison can be found in \[Appendix 1\]. |
| Anyone receiving an open source compliance enquiry from outside the \[FOUNDATION\] shall refer it to the Open Source Liaison who shall, in consultation with the Open Source Compliance Lead \[whose details are in Appendix 1\], have overall responsibility for dealing with the enquiry, and, where appropriate, assigning  the handling of all or part of it to suitable individuals within the \[FOUNDATION\], or, where they determine appropriate, to External Legal Counsel whose details are \[also in Appendix 1\]. |
| **Responsibility and Resourcing** |
| The Open Source Compliance Lead is primarily responsible for day-to-day internal open source compliance issues, supported by the \[list persons, groups and their functions whose details are in Appendix 1\]. The \[FOUNDATION\] may outsource the role of Open Source Compliance Lead to a third party, provided that third party complies with this Policy as if they were internal to the \[FOUNDATION\]. |
| The \[FOUNDATION\] shall ensure that the identified program roles are staffed, adequately funded and allocated with time to perform their duties. Any individual in an identified program role who believes that their role is inadequately resourced and funded must take up the issue with the Open Source Compliance Lead who shall investigate and seek to resolve the issue promptly, and failing effective resolution of the issue, shall take it up with the Open Source Compliance Board Member. |
| We engage \[the law firm Bristows LLP, and Orcro Limited, a specialist open source compliance company\] to provide legal and associated compliance advice. Any legal or compliance requests should be routed to \[Open Source Compliance Lead\] who will determine whether it is necessary to involve external advisers. The efficacy and appropriateness of our external advisers shall be assessed and reviewed at least annually by the Open Source Compliance Lead. |
| The Open Source Compliance Lead \[and &lt;list supporting persons, groups and their functions as set out in Appendix 1&gt;\] shall be primarily responsible for the resolution of day-to-day internal compliance issues, as well as updating and reviewing this policy.  <br><br/>The Open Source Compliance Lead shall be responsible for  <br>• Reviewing, implementing and communicating this policy;  <br>• Reviewing and implementing training and assessment for open source compliance related issues (in conjunction with \[FOUNDATION\]'s HR or Equivalent\];  <br>• Overseeing the activities of the Open Source Liaison;  <br>• Categorising identified licenses;  <br>• Keeping themselves appraised of up-to-date issues around open source compliance, including involvement with appropriate forums, user groups and mailing lists, and keeping in regular contact with the external legal \[and compliance\] advisors as set out in Appendix 1;  <br>• Keeping the Board, and in particular, the Open Source Compliance Board Member, up to date with activities affected by this open source policy;  <br>• \[list any additional persons, groups and their responsibilities as further set out in Appendix 1\] |
| Should a non-compliance issue be raised, the Open Source Compliance Lead shall:  <br><br/>1\. Acknowledge receipt of the query and state a reasonable time for resolution;  <br>2\. Determine whether the query discloses a genuine issue or not (and if not, respond to the querier accordingly);  <br>3\. If the issue is genuine, apply \[Appendix 4: incident severity criteria\] to prioritise;  <br>4\. Determine the appropriate response according to \[Appendix 4: incident response criteria\];  <br>5\. Carry out response in accordance with criteria, changing client terms of business etc. as appropriate; and  <br>6\. Document the above in the open source log. |
| **Open source content review and approval** |
| We have a process for ensuring that only code meeting our quality, licensing, provenance and functional requirements is incorporated into our code base and supplied software. All code must be approved before incorporation, and all code use (and the decisions that led to its inclusion) must be properly documented in the open source log.  <br><br/>All projects which are within the scope of this program will consider contributions from third parties provided that those third parties have entered into the standard \[Contributor License Agreement/Developer Certificate of Origin\] and are not otherwise excluded. Where an external contributor requests to incorporate any third party code, that code shall only be incorporated into the codebase by the Open Source Compliance Lead or other authorised program participant in accordance with the code selection procedure \[set out in Appendix 3\] and other requirements set out in this policy.  <br><br/>Although external contributors are not required to adhere to this policy, they are encouraged to read it and familiarise themselves with it. They will be asked to provide information about the provenance of any third party code which they propose to incorporate into the code base, so that the Open Source Compliance Lead (or authorised program participant) can make a determination, in accordance with this policy, as to whether it should be included or not. Understanding the criteria for inclusion (and asking appropriate questions before starting to consider third party code) will save time for both the contributor and the Open Source Compliance Lead. |
| All decisions carried out under this policy shall be recorded in the open source log, with details of the background, decision made, date, source of request, and name of the decision maker.  <br><br/>The open source log shall be reviewed annually, and any entries relating to code which is no longer currently used or distributed shall be flagged. All such entries shall be archived after \[three years\] of being flagged, and shall be anonymised after \[six years\]. |
| The open source log shall be maintained so as to ensure that each entry is cross referenced to the supplied software release or releases it referred to, to enable it to be sorted so that a subset of all log entries for a specific release can be produced, demonstrating that this procedure has been properly followed. |
| **License compliance** |
| \[Appendix 2: licenses\] contains a list of frequently encountered licenses covering the code in each release of supplied software categorising how each license deals with distribution in binary form, source form, strong or weak copyleft, provided on a SaaS basis, is modified or contains attribution requirements. Any code which is released under a license not in the database shall be referred to review as set out in \[reference\].  <br><br/>The inclusion of any code into any release of supplied software shall follow \[Appendix 3: Source acceptability criteria\]. |
| **Compliance artifact creation and delivery** |
| Open source licenses attach a variety of requirements to the distribution of source and/or binaries. Some require notices to be displayed by or with the running code, while others have requirements relating to the content and location of attribution, copyright statements, disclaimers and similar. Copyleft licenses also require copies of corresponding source to be made available to the recipient or to the general public. A failure to comply with any of these requirements would breach the license and amount to non-compliance with this policy with potentially serious consequences. For convenience, all these various materials are called "compliance artifacts", and the compilation of them into a specific release of supplied software is called the compliance log book. |
| For each component which is incorporated into a supplied software release, the appropriate compliance artifacts shall be compiled into the compliance log book for that release. The compliance log book shall be compiled in such a format that it complies with the relevant license terms (for example, it may be necessary to provide the specific text of a license, rather than a link to the text). Where appropriate, and required by the mode of distribution of the release, the compliance log book shall also be published online at \[insert link\].  <br><br/>Where the distribution mode of the supplied software release is from a specific repository which also contains the source code, the project repository shall be considered to be the “compliance log book” provided that it complies with all the requirements of the identified licenses, and it shall therefore be considered to be “published” for the purposes of this policy.  <br><br/>In general, we favour providing the whole of the text of the relevant license in the compliance log book, even if only providing part of the text (e.g. an attribution notice and disclaimer) is permissible. |
| The compliance artifacts for all previous releases of supplied software shall be retained \[in the open source log\] and archived as set out above \[insert reference\]. |
| **Open Source community engagement** |
| **Contributing to Open Source Projects** |
| Our own open source projects have a vibrant community around them, and we encourage participation from people both inside and outside the \[FOUNDATION\].  <br><br/>We recognise the benefits of becoming involved in other relevant open source projects, from personal satisfaction of our team, through to gaining in-depth understanding of the project in question, being able to help influence the direction of movement of the project as a whole, and also ensuring that any bug fixes and enhancements we contribute are not kept to ourselves (which would, over time, mean we have forked the project, and creates a support headache) but become part of the main supported release. We also support interoperability of open source projects, and adherence to open standards. |
| We encourage our team to get involved in open source (and similar) projects outside the \[FOUNDATION\]. If you want to join a project, please see the Open Source Compliance Lead for more information. Aside from projects that the \[FOUNDATION\] has involvement in, feel free to contribute to other projects in your own time. Note, however, your obligations to the \[FOUNDATION\] relating to trade secrets, confidential information our own intellectual property. For this reason, you must clear any participation with the \[Open Source Compliance Lead \| Open Source Liaison\] before starting to contribute to projects which may have some connection with your work for the \[FOUNDATION\]. Permission will only be withheld in exceptional circumstances. |
| In order to contribute to an external open source project on behalf of the \[FOUNDATION\], you may be asked to sign a developer certificate of origin, a contributor license agreement, or other document. It may be the case that we already have a signed blanket agreement in place, for example. Before contributing to any open source projects, you must check with Open Source Compliance Lead, and make sure that all requirements relating to documentation are fulfilled. You may use your \[FOUNDATION\] email address to register and identify yourself as the source of contributions once this clearance has been obtained. |
| More information about contributing to open source projects can be found \[HERE\] and the policy and training related to it is covered in the training referred to in \[REF:TRAINING\] above. |
| **OpenChain Standard** |
| **Conformance** |
| The \[FOUNDATION\] supports the Linux Foundation's OpenChain project. This is a conformance program designed to ensure that we know what code we have and are using; that it complies with the licensing obligations attached to it; that our team are trained in and understand issues around open source licensing and their use and deployment of code within the \[FOUNDATION\], and that the \[FOUNDATION\] has both internally- and externally-facing open source officers who are able to handle queries and support the \[FOUNDATION\]'s open source use and deployment. This policy has been carefully designed to be compliant with the OpenChain Specification v2.1, ISO/IEC 5230:2020. For more information about the OpenChain project, please see OpenChainProject.org. |
| The \[FOUNDATION\] affirms that as of  <br>• \[insert date\] and in respect of \[describe supplied software A\]  <br>• \[insert date\] and in respect of \[describe supplied software B\]  <br>it is in compliance with the OpenChain Specification v 2.1, ISO/IEC 5230:2020. \[Our public declaration can be found here \[insert link\]\]. |
| **Duration** |
| The \[FOUNDATION\] affirms that within the past 18 months of obtaining conformance validation, the program meets all the requirements of the OpenChain Specification v2.1, ISO/IEC 5230:2020. \[Our public declaration can be found here \[insert link\]\].  <br><br/>The \[FOUNDATION\]'s affirmation of conformance will be reviewed and renewed if appropriate at intervals of at least \[12\|18 months\].  <br><br/>The effectiveness and performance of this open source policy will be reviewed at \[the same time as affirmation\], and changes will be made and communicated in line with this policy where appropriate. |
| **Policy Acceptance/Acknowledgement** |
| \[add a recorded clickthrough acceptance mechanism or a signature block if done on paper\]  <br><br/>By \[ticking/signing\] and accepting this you confirm your understanding and acceptance of this open source policy and that you are aware of each program personnel and the program's objectives, your contribution within the program, and the implications of program non-conformance.  <br><br/>This policy shall not form part of any employment contract with the \[FOUNDATION\] and you hereby consent to the \[FOUNDATION\] varying this open source policy and the related program from time to time, without your consent. |
