    (A) [COMPANY] understands that open source licenses permit the use, study, improvement and sharing of software without seeking further permission. Open source software is a vital component in the software ecosystem and is a valuable resource that:
    -  Provides quality software and software-based services;
    -  Reduces vendor lock-in;
    -  Reduces the likelihood of security issues;
    -  Reduces development time;
    -  Grants access to developer communities;
    -  Aids the attraction and retention of skilled and satisfied staff.
  Foundations Specific: |-
    The [FOUNDATION] is committed to open development, and believes that free and open source software provides the best framework for both providing value for money, [and therefore the public purse], and also the highest quality software.

    (B) [COMPANY] also understands that using open source or proprietary software presents some risks and that:
    -  Open source software is not automatically high quality;
    -  Open source licensing is complex, and compliance with the licensing terms needs careful consideration, documentation and following of processes;
    -  Other software which has some similar characteristics to open source software (such as non-commercial or shared source) is not open source software;
    -  Incorrect deployment and distribution of open source software can lead to breaches of intellectual property rights, which, if they can be remedied at, may potentially only be remediable by the release of our trade secrets, including source code;
    -  It can be difficult to find warranty cover for open source code and performance;
    -  Open source software can be misunderstood, and may be viewed suspiciously by customers and investors.
  Foundations Specific: |-
    The [FOUNDATION] recognises that using open source software presents some risks (particularly in terms of the consequences of non-compliance with its license terms). By adopting appropriate policies, practices and procedures, these risks can be address and minimised. This policy is compliant with the OpenChain Specification v2.1, ISO/IEC 5230:2020, an industry standard for open source license compliance.
