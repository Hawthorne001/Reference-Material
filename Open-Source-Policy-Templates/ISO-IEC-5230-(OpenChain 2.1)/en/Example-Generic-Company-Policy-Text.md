| **Generic Company Policy Text** |
| --- |
| **\[COMPANY\] Open Source Policy** |
| **Introduction and Purpose** |
| (A) \[COMPANY\] understands that open source licenses permit the use, study, improvement and sharing of software without seeking further permission. Open source software is a vital component in the software ecosystem and is a valuable resource that:  <br>• Provides quality software and software-based services;  <br>• Reduces vendor lock-in;  <br>• Reduces the likelihood of security issues;  <br>• Reduces development time;  <br>• Grants access to developer communities;  <br>• Aids the attraction and retention of skilled and satisfied staff. |
| (B) \[COMPANY\] also understands that using open source or proprietary software presents some risks and that:  <br>• Open source software is not automatically high quality;  <br>• Open source licensing is complex, and compliance with the licensing terms needs careful consideration, documentation and following of processes;  <br>• Other software which has some similar characteristics to open source software (such as non-commercial or shared source) is not open source software;  <br>• Incorrect deployment and distribution of open source software can lead to breaches of intellectual property rights, which, if they can be remedied at, may potentially only be remediable by the release of our trade secrets, including source code;  <br>• It can be difficult to find warranty cover for open source code and performance;  <br>• Open source software can be misunderstood, and may be viewed suspiciously by customers and investors. |
| (C) The purpose of this policy is to assist \[COMPANY\] in getting the best business value from open source software while mitigating risks, primarily relating to breach of applicable license terms. All program participants will be made aware of this policy though, for example, training, internal wiki/knowledge base. |
| **Definitions** |
| "compliance artifacts" - each artifact which represents the output of the open source management program for each component of a supplied software release. This may include (but is not limited to) one or more of the following: source code, attribution notices, copyright notices, copy of licenses, modification notifications, written offers, open source component bill of materials, SPDX documents and so forth. |
| "compliance log book" - the complete set of compliance artifacts which are made available to third parties to comply with the requirements of the licenses applicable to supplied software for a specific release, in the appropriate form to ensure compliance (e.g. license text may be required, as opposed to a link to the license text). |
| "identified licenses” - a set of open source software licenses identified as a result of following an appropriate method of identifying open source components from which the supplied software is comprised. |

| **Introduction** |
| Our open source policy can be found \[on the \[COMPANY\]\]intranet at \[LINK\]. |
| All joining program participants will be made aware of the open source policy, and associated training policy and its location during the induction process. This will be recorded on the \[induction checklist \| HR system\]. |
| You can find \[COMPANY\]'s list of roles and corresponding responsibilities for the different program participants in \[see Appendix 1 for a sample\]. |
| You can find \[COMPANY\]'s list of competencies for each role in the program in \[see Appendix 1 for a sample\]. |
| All program participants must undertake training covering the competencies required for their role, and at a minimum basic training. Appendix 5 contains details of the training requirements for each role. |
| Every program participant will be assessed, and records of the assessment will be found \[in the \[COMPANY\] learning management system\]\[will be kept by the HR department\] and retained for \[at least 6 years\]. |
| **Overview** |
| • A copy of our open source policy can be found at \[insert link\].  <br>• Our open source objectives are set out in the introduction to this policy.  <br>• You contribute to the effectiveness of the program by understanding the rationale behind, and content of, this policy. This includes keeping yourself up to date with our business practices, and also keeping up to date with current software development practices and techniques. You can do this by following news sources like \[insert sources\], participating in \[list forums, mailing lists\], and undertaking training activities. If you have any questions relating to this policy, or to our practices and procedures relating to open source, please do not hesitate to contact \[Open Source Compliance Lead - see Appendix 1\].  <br>• It is important that \[COMPANY\] adheres to this policy. Failure to do so may lead to:  <br>• legal claims from the holders of copyright or other intellectual property rights in code we use;  <br>• claims from our customers;  <br>• the inadvertent release of \[COMPANY\] proprietary code;  <br>• breach of regulatory obligations by \[COMPANY\] potentially leading to fines;  <br>• loss of reputation;  <br>• loss of revenue;  <br>• breach of contract with suppliers and customers.  <br>For this reason, we take breaches of this policy seriously, and any individual breaching the policy may find themselves subject to \[COMPANY\]'s disciplinary procedure. |
| The \[COMPANY\]'s training and assessment program will cover the objectives of each program in which you participate, your role within the program, and implications to the company and to individuals for non-conformance. Evidence of your assessment will be \[contained in the \[COMPANY\] learning management system\]\[maintained by the HR department\]. |
| **Program scope** |
| The Open Source Compliance Lead will consider at the initiation of any new project within \[COMPANY\] whether that project should also be included within the scope of the program, and if so, that proposal shall be made to the Board Members through the Open Source Compliance Board Member and if the proposal is adopted, the scope of the program, and if necessary, this policy, will be amended accordingly. The Open Source Compliance Lead may also initiate a review of the scope of the program at any time they consider it appropriate to do so, following the same process. |
| This open source policy covers \[all products which COMPANY makes available or distributes externally\]. \[In future, the COMPANY may determine that different products and projects are part of different programs, and each program may have a different scope\]. |
| **License Review and Obligations** |
| Our procedure for reviewing and documenting the obligations, restrictions and rights granted by each identified license is as follows:  <br>• \[Open Source Compliance Lead\] makes a preliminary assessment of the license based on the criteria set out in \[Appendix 2\].  <br>• In case of any doubt, \[Open Source Compliance Lead\] refers the question to \[External Legal Counsel\]\[whose details are in Appendix 1\].  <br>• The outcome of any determination, and associated rationale (whether internal or external) is recorded in the open source log. |
| **External Liaison** |
| Details of our Open Source Liaison can be found at \[link to externally facing website\]. Further details of our Open Source Liaison can be found in \[Appendix 1\]. |
| Anyone receiving an open source compliance inquiry from outside the \[COMPANY\] shall refer it to the Open Source Liaison who shall, in consultation with the Open Source Compliance Lead \[both of whose details are in Appendix 1\], have overall responsibility for dealing with the enquiry, and, where appropriate, assigning the handling of all or part of it to suitable individuals within \[COMPANY\], or, where they determine appropriate, to External Legal Counsel whose details are \[also in Appendix 1\]. |
| **Responsibility and Resourcing** |
| The Open Source Compliance Lead is primarily responsible for day-to-day internal open source compliance issues, supported by the \[list persons, groups and their functions whose details are in Appendix 1\]. |
| \[COMPANY\] shall ensure that the identified program roles are staffed, adequately funded and allocated with time to perform their duties. Any individual in an identified program role who believes that their role is inadequately resourced and funded must take up the issue with the Open Source Compliance Lead who shall investigate and seek to resolve the issue promptly, and failing effective resolution of the issue, shall take it up with the Open Source Compliance Board Member. |
| We engage \[the law firm Bristows LLP, and Orcro Limited, a specialist open source compliance company\] to provide legal and associated compliance advice. Any legal or compliance requests should be routed to \[Open Source Compliance Lead\] who will determine whether it is necessary to involve external advisers. The efficacy and appropriateness of our external advisers shall be assessed and reviewed at least annually by the Open Source Compliance Lead. |
| The Open Source Compliance Lead \[and &lt;list supporting persons, groups and their functions as set out in Appendix 1&gt;\] shall be primarily responsible for the resolution of day-to-day internal compliance issues, as well as updating and reviewing this policy.  <br><br/>The Open Source Compliance Lead shall be responsible for  <br>• Reviewing, implementing and communicating this policy;  <br>• Reviewing and implementing training and assessment for open source compliance related issues (in conjunction with HR);  <br>• Overseeing the activities of the Open Source Liaison;  <br>• Categorising identified licenses;  <br>• Keeping themselves appraised of up-to-date issues around open source compliance, including involvement with appropriate forums, user groups and mailing lists, and keeping in regular contact with the external legal \[and compliance\] advisors as set out in Appendix 1;  <br>• Keeping the Board, and in particular, the Open Source Compliance Board Member, up to date with activities affected by this open source policy;  <br>• \[list any additional persons, groups and their responsibilities as further set out in Appendix 1\] |
| Should a non-compliance issue be raised, the Open Source Compliance Lead shall:  <br><br/>1\. Acknowledge receipt of the query and state a reasonable time for resolution;  <br>2\. Determine whether the query discloses a genuine issue or not (and if not, respond to the querier accordingly);  <br>3\. If the issue is genuine, apply \[Appendix 4: incident severity criteria\] to prioritise;  <br>4\. Determine the appropriate response according to \[Appendix 4: incident response criteria\];  <br>5\. Carry out response in accordance with criteria, changing client terms of business etc. as appropriate; and  <br>6\. Document the above in the open source log. |
| **Open source content review and approval** |
| We have a process for ensuring that only code meeting our quality, licensing, provenance and functional requirements is incorporated into our code base and supplied software. All code must be approved before incorporation, and all code use (and the decisions that led to its inclusion) must be properly documented in the open source log. |
| All decisions carried out under this policy shall be recorded in the open source log, with details of the background, decision made, date, source of request, and name of the decision maker.  <br><br/>The open source log shall be reviewed annually, and any entries relating to code which is no longer currently used or distributed shall be flagged. All such entries shall be archived after \[three years\] of being flagged, and shall be anonymised after \[six years\]. |
| The open source log shall be maintained so as to ensure that each entry is cross referenced to the supplied software release or releases it referred to, to enable it to be sorted so that a subset of all log entries for a specific release can be produced, demonstrating that this procedure has been properly followed. |
| **License compliance** |
| \[Appendix 2: licenses\] contains a list of frequently encountered licenses covering the code in each release of supplied software categorising how each license deals with distribution in binary form, source form, strong or weak copyleft, provided on a SaaS basis, is modified or contains attribution requirements. Any code which is released under a license not in the database shall be referred to review as set out in \[reference\].  <br><br/>The inclusion of any code into any release of supplied software shall follow \[Appendix 3: Source acceptability criteria\]. |
| **Compliance artifact creation and delivery** |
| Open source licenses attach a variety of requirements to the distribution of source and/or binaries. Some require notices to be displayed by or with the running code, while others have requirements relating to the content and location of attribution, copyright statements, disclaimers and similar. Copyleft licenses also require copies of corresponding source to be made available to the recipient or to the general public. A failure to comply with any of these requirements would breach the license and amount to non-compliance with this policy with potentially serious consequences. For convenience, all these various materials are called "compliance artifacts", and the compilation of them into a specific release of supplied software is called the compliance log book. |
| For each component which is incorporated into a supplied software release, the appropriate compliance artifacts shall be compiled into the compliance log book for that release. The compliance log book shall be compiled in such a format that it complies with the relevant license terms (for example, it may be necessary to provide the specific text of a license, rather than a link to the text). Where appropriate, and required by the mode of distribution of the release, the compliance log book shall also be published online at \[insert link\].  <br><br/>In general, we favour providing the whole of the text of the relevant license in the compliance log book, even if only providing part of the text (e.g. an attribution notice and disclaimer) is permissible. |
| The compliance artifacts for all previous releases of supplied software shall be retained \[in the open source log\] and archived as set out above \[insert reference\]. |
| **Open Source community engagement** |
| **Contributing to Open Source Projects** |
| \[Our own open source projects have a vibrant community around them, and we encourage participation from people both inside and outside \[COMPANY\]. For more information, please see \[OUR PROJECT AND COMMUNITY\]\].  <br><br/>We recognise the benefits of becoming involved in open source projects, from personal satisfaction of our team, through to gaining in-depth understanding of the project in question, being able to help influence the direction of movement of the project as a whole, and also ensuring that any bug fixes and enhancements we contribute are not kept to ourselves (which would, over time, mean we have forked the project, and creates a support headache) but become part of the main supported release.  <br><br/><br/>OR  <br><br/><br/>We recognise the benefit of open source projects and are supportive of their goals. Where deemed appropriate by the Open Source Liaison we may contribute bug fixes or other material to projects of our choosing. Unapproved contributions may not be made by any staff of the company at any time. |
| We encourage our team to get involved in open source (and similar) projects outside \[COMPANY\]. If you want to join a project, please see the Open Source Compliance Lead for more information. Aside from projects that \[COMPANY\] has involvement in, feel free to contribute to other projects in your own time. Note, however, your obligations to \[COMPANY\] relating to trade secrets, confidential information and our intellectual property. For this reason, you must clear any participation with Open Source Compliance Lead before starting to contribute to projects which may have some connection with your work for \[COMPANY\].  <br><br/>OR  <br><br/><br/>We do not generally encourage involvement in open source (and similar) projects outside \[COMPANY\]. If you wish to become involved in a project outside \[COMPANY\] please seek explicit permission from the Open Source Liaison. This is required given your obligations to \[COMPANY\] relating to confidential information, trade secrets and our intellectual property. |
| In order to contribute to an approved open source project, you may be asked to sign a developer certificate of origin, a contributor license agreement, or other document. It may be the case that we already have a signed blanket agreement in place, for example. Before contributing to any open source projects, you must check with Open Source Compliance Lead, and make sure that all requirements relating to documentation are fulfilled. You may use your \[COMPANY\] email address to register and identify yourself as the source of contributions once this clearance has been obtained. |
| More information about contributing to open source projects can be found \[HERE\] and the policy and training related to it is covered in the training referred to in \[REF:TRAINING\] above. |
| **OpenChain Standard** |
| **Conformance** |
| \[COMPANY\] supports the Linux Foundation's OpenChain project. This is a conformance program designed to ensure that we know what code we have and are using; that it complies with the licensing obligations attached to it; that our team are trained in and understand issues around open source licensing and their use and deployment of code within \[COMPANY\], and that \[COMPANY\] has both internally- and externally-facing open source officers who are able to handle queries and support COMPANY's open source use and deployment. This policy has been carefully designed to be compliant with the OpenChain Specification v2.1, ISO/IEC 5230:2020. For more information about the OpenChain project, please see OpenChainProject.org |
| \[COMPANY\] affirms that as of  <br>• \[insert date\] and in respect of \[describe supplied software A\]  <br>• \[insert date\] and in respect of \[describe supplied software B\]  <br>it is in compliance with the OpenChain Specification v 2.1, ISO/IEC 5230:2020. \[Our public declaration can be found here \[insert link\]\]. |
| **Duration** |
| \[COMPANY\] affirms that within the past 18 months of obtaining conformance validation, the program meets all the requirements of the OpenChain Specification v2.1, ISO/IEC 5230:2020. \[Our public declaration can be found here \[insert link\]\].  <br><br/>\[COMPANY\]'s affirmation of conformance will be reviewed and renewed if appropriate at intervals of at least \[12\|18 months\].  <br><br/>The effectiveness and performance of this open source policy will be reviewed at \[the same time as affirmation\], and changes will be made and communicated in line with this policy where appropriate. |
| **Policy Acceptance/Acknowledgement** |
| \[add a recorded clickthrough acceptance mechanism or a signature block if done on paper\]  <br><br/>By \[ticking/signing\] and accepting this you confirm your understanding and acceptance of this open source policy and that you are aware of each program personnel and the program's objectives, your contribution within the program, and the implications of program non-conformance.  <br><br/>This policy shall not form part of your employment contract with \[COMPANY\] and you hereby consent to the \[COMPANY\] varying this open source policy and the related program from time to time, without your consent. |
