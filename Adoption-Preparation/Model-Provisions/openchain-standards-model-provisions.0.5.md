# Overview

This is a document to explore model provisions for OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 or ISO/IEC DIS 18974 in procurement contracts and similar material. It is based on the public domain Risk Grid version 12 hosted in the OpenChain Reference Library on GitHub:
https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/Reference-Material/blob/master/General-Compliance-Support-Material/Risk-Grid/risk-grid-12.md

The goal of this document is to ensure people can understand options. We will not be prescriptive and these model provisions will remain part of the OpenChain reference material. They will not be included in the OpenChain standards themselves.

# Series of Due Diligence Questions to be used prior to preparation of contract

Note: this document is to be interpreted consistently with the OpenChain Specification 2.1 (ISO5230:2020) ("OpenChain"). For a copy of the OpenChain specification, please see here [insert link]. In each case, if the answer to a question below is *yes*, please provide details. 
	
### Q0.1: Do you have any formal certifications or conformance assessments relating to your open source compliance activities (e.g. OpenChain, ISO/IEC 5230:2020). These can be self certifications or external certifications.

### Q0.2 If yes, is the software to be developed for us developed under a program which conforms to these certifications or assessments? 

### Q1:	Do you have a policy for selecting, using and deploying free and open source software (FOSS) components?

### Q2:	Do you provide training to staff on selecting and incorporating FOSS into your products?

### Q3:	Do you have a process for reviewing FOSS licences and categorising the obligations/conditions attached to them? 

### Q3.1 Do you have a method of recording decisions made as to whether a particular component should be incorporated or not? 

### Q3.2 Are these records attributable to specific version(s) or release(s) of software?

### Q3.3 How long are the records archived for?

### Q4:	Do you use any software tools or services to assist with open source license compliance? (For example, Black Duck, Scancode, White Source, FOSSology, SW360)

### Q5.1: Have you appointed individuals with overall responsibility for open source license compliance policies, practice and procedures?

### Q5.2: Have you appointed individuals with overall responsibility for responding to open source queries from outside the organization?

### Q6: Can you provide a complete list of open source components and their respective licensing information used in any software you use or ship?

### Q7:	Do you provide customers with all materials required by the relevant open source software licenses (e.g. source code or offers to provide source, attribution notices, installation instructions)?

### Q8:	Does your organization contribute to external open source projects? Do you have a policy for handling this?


# OpenChain based representations for use in a procurement contract

*Note: This is a set of representations and obligations to be incorporated in a procurement contract. The structure follows ISO:5230:2020. The representations may also be modified to take effect as warranties and/or indemnities depending on local law and as agreed between the parties.* 

*If due diligence determines that the supplier claims to be ISO 5230:2020 compliant, the following warranties apply. If the customer is **not** compliant with ISO 5230:2020 then extra care should be taken in selecting this supplier (and they should be encouraged to implement the relevant requirements, and ideally comply with ISO 5230:2020 in its entirety, and the warranties marked with an asterisk (\*) can be deleted* 

[Note: Alternatively, we can produce shortened set of reps applying to companies which have already confirmed they are OpenChain conformant]
