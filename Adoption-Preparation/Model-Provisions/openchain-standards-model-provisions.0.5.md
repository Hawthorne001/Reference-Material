# Overview

This is a document to explore model provisions for OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 or ISO/IEC DIS 18974 in procurement contracts and similar material. It is based on the public domain Risk Grid version 12 hosted in the OpenChain Reference Library on GitHub:
https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/Reference-Material/blob/master/General-Compliance-Support-Material/Risk-Grid/risk-grid-12.md

The goal of this document is to ensure people can understand options. We will not be prescriptive and these model provisions will remain part of the OpenChain reference material. They will not be included in the OpenChain standards themselves.

### Q0.1: Do you have any formal certifications or conformance assessments relating to your open source compliance activities (e.g. OpenChain, ISO/IEC 5230:2020). These can be self certifications or external certifications.

### Q0.2 If yes, is the software to be developed for us developed under a program which conforms to these certifications or assessments? 

### Q1:	Do you have a policy for selecting, using and deploying free and open source software (FOSS) components?

### Q2:	Do you provide training to staff on selecting and incorporating FOSS into your products?

### Q3:	Do you have a process for reviewing FOSS licences and categorising the obligations/conditions attached to them? 

### Q3.1 Do you have a method of recording decisions made as to whether a particular component should be incorporated or not? 

### Q3.2 Are these records attributable to specific version(s) or release(s) of software?

### Q3.3 How long are the records archived for?

### Q4:	Do you use any software tools or services to assist with open source license compliance? (For example, Black Duck, Scancode, White Source, FOSSology, SW360)

### Q5.1: Have you appointed individuals with overall responsibility for open source license compliance policies, practice and procedures?

### Q5.2: Have you appointed individuals with overall responsibility for responding to open source queries from outside the organization?

### Q6: Can you provide a complete list of open source components and their respective licensing information used in any software you use or ship?

### Q7:	Do you provide customers with all materials required by the relevant open source software licenses (e.g. source code or offers to provide source, attribution notices, installation instructions)?

### Q8:	Does your organization contribute to external open source projects? Do you have a policy for handling this?


# OpenChain based representations for use in a procurement contract

*Note: This is a set of representations and obligations to be incorporated in a procurement contract. The structure follows ISO:5230:2020. The representations may also be modified to take effect as warranties and/or indemnities depending on local law and as agreed between the parties.* 

*If due diligence determines that the supplier claims to be ISO 5230:2020 compliant, the following warranties apply. If the customer is **not** compliant with ISO 5230:2020 then extra care should be taken in selecting this supplier (and they should be encouraged to implement the relevant requirements, and ideally comply with ISO 5230:2020 in its entirety, and the warranties marked with an asterisk (\*) can be deleted* 

[Note: Alternatively, we can produce shortened set of reps applying to companies which have already confirmed they are OpenChain conformant]

#### Customer's Arguments　

The Customer is receiving a potential liability regarding security along with the Software deliverable from the Supplier. As such, it is reasonable to request that the Supplier adheres to international standards related to the managing of security assurance related to the Software.

### Issue - Determining if the OpenChain Conformant Program is self-certified or third-party certified

#### Commentary　

None listed.

#### Who is best placed to bear risk?　

Supplier

#### Best mechanism to tackle risk　

None listed.

#### Sample Wording　

The Supplier warrants that the OpenChain [ISO/IEC 5230:2000][ISO/IEC DIS 18974] Conformant Program [or Programs] referenced in the relevant [purchasing agreement[s]] [contract[s]] is self-certified as per the checklists or questionnaires provided by the OpenChain Project.

or

The Supplier warrants that the OpenChain [ISO/IEC 5230:2000][ISO/IEC DIS 18974] Conformant Program [or Programs] referenced in the relevant [purchasing agreement[s]] [contract[s]] is third-party certified by [registered] [licensed] third-party certified.

and

[The Supplier will produce documentation to verify that the OpenChain [ISO/IEC 5230:2000][ISO/IEC DIS 18974] Conformant Program [or Programs] has undergone the disclosed certification process.]

#### Supplier's Arguments　

None.

#### Customer's Arguments　

The Customer requires clarity regarding the type of certification that the Supplier has undergone to contextualize their risk. A Customer may regard third-party certification as preferable due to the inherent audit involved. Alternatively, a Customer may be satisfied that self-certification is sufficient given that OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230:2000 or ISO/IEC DIS 18974 both require the party with a conformant program to maintain documentation on how they accomplished their conformance.  

### Issue - Risk that the Declaration is just pro-forma, how to verify?

#### Commentary　

None listed.

#### Who is best placed to bear risk?　

Supplier

#### Best mechanism to tackle risk　

Audit rights

#### Sample Wording　

Customer may request that an audit be carried out to verify compliance to ISO/IEC 5230:2000 by a Third party auditor (**"Audit"**) that shall be approved by Supplier and such approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

The Audit is subject to the following conditions:

a. it must only concern Supplier's OpenChain-related material, processes, policies and other relevant Artefact as provided for by ISO/IEC 5230:2000 that are used to demonstrate compliance.
a. the auditor shall undertake a formal non disclosure agreement if it was not bound to professional secrecy by operation of the law;
a. it must be carried out no more than once a year;
a. it must come with an adequate advance notice, in no case less than 5 business days, and may be carried out during normal working hours, without interrupting the continuity of Supplier's activities or causing Supplier excessive burden and inconvenience, and in compliance with Supplier's safety policies;
a. Customer shall bear all expenses arising out of or in connection with Audits at Supplier's premises, unless such Audits reveal that Supplier is not acting in compliance ISO/IEC 5230:2000, in which case all expenses shall be borne by Supplier.  Customer may prepare an audit report summarizing the results and observations of the Audits (**"Audit Report"**);
a. If at all possible, the Audit shall be documental, but the auditor may interview personnel of the Supplier to verify the level of compliance.

Audit Reports are confidential information of Supplier and Customer undertakes not to disclose them to third parties, with the exception of its own consultants, including legal consultants and its own employees.

Supplier can respond to a request to carry out an audit by handing over a recent Audit Report performed by a reputable third part; such handing over may carry reasonably confidentiality conditions. A recent Audit Report is a report that was formed no more than 10 months prior to the request to carry over the audit. Customer shall not unreasonably refuse to accept such Audit Report *in lieu* of a full audit, but can demand to carry over an audit on areas which have not been accurately described or which have not been covered by the Audit Report.

[in case Supplier is self-certified] Supplier may retain the auditor for becoming third-party certified or to renew third-party certification, but any such request may not be made earlier than one calendar month after the Audit Report has been delivered.

#### Supplier's Arguments　

Cost and complication of an audit process, confidentiality.

#### Customer's Arguments　

Costs are borne mainly by Customer, confidentiality is tackled by NDA and the process is run by a third party, frequency is limited and the audit can be done by showing a reliable audit done by a reputable third party.
