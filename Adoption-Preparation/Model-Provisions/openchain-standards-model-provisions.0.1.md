# Overview

This is a document to explore model provisions for OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230 or ISO/IEC DIS 18974 in procurement contracts and similar material. It is based on the public domain Risk Grid version 12 hosted in the OpenChain Reference Library on GitHub:
https://github.com/OpenChain-Project/Reference-Material/blob/master/General-Compliance-Support-Material/Risk-Grid/risk-grid-12.md

The goal of this document is to ensure people can understand options. We will not be prescriptive and these model provisions will remain part of the OpenChain reference material. They will not be included in the OpenChain standards themselves.
