# Path to Conformance 
## Version 1
## 2022-10-18

We recognize that organizations in our community are at different levels in building their open source compliance processes. We illustrate this process as four levels in the “Path to Conformance.” For each level, we are gathering resources to support our community organization moved through the conformance process.

# Level 1

Awareness of Open Source License or Security Compliance
Organizations in this stage may be asking:

- What is open source license or security compliance?
- How does failing to meet license or security obligations impact engineering, business and legal teams?
- How do I communicate the importance of compliance to people inside and outside my organization?
