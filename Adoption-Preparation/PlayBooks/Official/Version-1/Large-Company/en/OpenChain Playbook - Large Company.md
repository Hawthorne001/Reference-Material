## Non-Prescriptive Examples of OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230:2020 implementation
 
# Introduction

The OpenChain PlayBooks are intended to help you understand the types of decisions made by managers in companies adopting OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230:2020. We cover examples of the decision-process in small, medium and large companies. Our examples are based on companies (a) in the technology industry, (b) in the middle of the supply chain and (c) shipping physical products containing software.

This may sound specific. However, the intention is to provide a thinking-tool for your company. Whether you are in the technology, finance, cloud, infrastructure or automotive industry (or any other), you will face similar challenges and solutions. The same applies whether you are in the middle of the supply chain or at its end, and whether you are shipping hardware or software. Our chosen examples cover a lot of ground.

There may be situations where you would like more examples for more specific industries. This is where the OpenChain community comes in. You can join our mailing lists, our webinars, our group calls and our regional work groups to discuss challenges with your peers and in your native language. You can get started here:

Finally, this PlayBook contains an appendix with all the questions you need to answer to become OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230:2020 conformant. If you can answer all of these questions with “yes,” you have a conformant program. If you answer some of the questions with “no,” you know where to invest resources.

# Large Company

## Challenge Definition

1. 	There are several business units, with different products, schedules and priorities, working to different historical processes (perhaps the business units began as other companies that were later acquired).
2.	 There are legacy products developed by staff who are no longer with the company.
3.	 We do not know all the places where open source software is used in our product (and may not even be sure what all the products are).
4.	 Products may be embedded software, desktop software, mobile software, Software-as-a-Service, and so on.
5.	 The company is geographically diverse, with teams or team members working at distinct sites, possibly in different legal jurisdictions.

## Our Challenge
* *Our customers may require us to be license compliant.*

# Current Situation

We currently have engineering resources using open source but no dedicated open source team or open source program. We are aware that certain key material is probably needed to ensure we manage open source effectively:

1. 	A policy that encapsulates the company’s strategy towards open source use.
2.	 A process or processes to ensure the relevant teams understand the policy.
3.	 A training program to ensure we can execute the policy.

# We have

1. 	A policy that includes a “permitted list” of projects we are comfortable with and a “denied list” of licenses we are not comfortable with. 
2.	 Some processes focused on engineering teams using the policy. 
3.	 A recurring training program for engineers known to be working on open source.
4.	 A legal department, which may include dedicated staff for compliance in different areas.
5.	 Requirements for following existing development processes or domain-specific quality standards.

# The People Involved
Senior engineering, legal and management staff.

## Personas
### The Senior Engineer

She has been working in this field for ten years and has been with this company for five years. She is experienced in developing proprietary software and has experience in using open source. While not an expert in open source licensing (or general licensing), she has basic knowledge regarding the obligations of key open source licenses and how they impact hardware distribution. This said, she is using “community knowledge” instead of deep personal expertise in the matter.

### The Legal Expert

He has been working in the field of software licensing for eight years and has always worked at this company. He is experienced in other areas of law too, particularly related to trademarks. He has limited experience in open source licensing and has relied on the engineering department to understand market norms. He has spent some time reading open source licenses, interpreting them and seeking to reconcile his interpretation with online resources. The match has not always been perfect.

### The Management Representative

They have been with this company for four years. Previously they were with a competing company for seven years. They have deep experience in product management but have largely relied on members of their teams or departments to deal with the details of software development and legal matters. They are aware that open source process management may need changing their level of involvement or adjustments in previously successful processes.

# Planning Our Strategy

We will use the OpenChain self-certification questionnaire as a way to check our current status versus the status required for OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230:2020 self-certification. This involves understanding the:

1. 	Current policy for managing decisions around open source (and other) software.
2.	 Current processes being used for managing open source (and other) software.
3.	 Current records showing the usage of this software over the previous year.

# Executing Our Plan

## Step 1

Identify a key sponsor for the project. Ideally, this will be a senior executive (C-suite) with ability to drive the activities, provide repeated vocal support and assist with budget needs.

Determine the scope of the initial work. This may be targeting a single product line, or a particular development team, a complete business unit or perhaps even the whole company at once. 

Form a team to carry out investigations.If the initial scope is wide, the team will need to incorporate representatives from across the targeted organization.

## Step 2

Carry out a survey of products produced by the target organization. Talk to representatives in the development teams, sales teams and finance teams, to gain an understanding of what is under development, what is being actively sold, what is being maintained, and what is still selling and shipping, even though no-one is working on it anymore.

For each product identified, also survey the open source used in the product (if any), and the processes and policies used for developing, building and shipping the product, in as far as they relate to open source usage. Note compliance tools in use, if any.

Produce a report enumerating the products identified.

## Step 3

Review the processes and policies identified by the survey, and compare them for consistency. Compare the processes and policies against OpenChain to identify gaps. Produce a report identifying the findings of the survey and comparisons, indicating where there are policy differences, process differences, and gaps in relation to OpenChain.

## Step 4

Revise the scope of the initial project. It may be decided that a specific subset of the surveyed target area will be the initial scope for implementation. Define the timeline for remediating the policies and processes used within the revised scope.

Define the initial needs for the OSPO: structure, staffing, tooling, budget. Determine where the OSPO will live within the company.

Gain buy-in from the senior sponsor, and gain approval for the budget and staffing.

Hire the OSPO leader and initial staff.

## Step 5

The OSPO produces revised policies and processes, and works with the product teams for the revised scope to implement the new processes.

The OSPO works to update the existing onboarding training, to reflect new processes.

NOTE: It is recommended that these documents be as short and as simple as possible. Unless the company already has sophisticated processes in place the company can build the compliance program over time. It is far better to have something basic that can be implemented soon rather than something perfect that will take too long to implement.

## Step 6

The OSPO holds meetings during the midpoint and the endpoint of the timelines for implementation in each department. The goals are:

1. 	To support and encourage each department in the execution of the plan with the combined experience of the OSPO members.
2.	 To keep the management team informed of progress and to adjust timescales as necessary to ensure success.

# Reviewing Our Results

When each department reports their activity is complete, the OSPO has a special workshop to review the results against OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230:2020 self-certification questionnaire. 

1. 	If the results match the questionnaire the OSPO team members create a report to management explaining that self-certification conformance is complete. 
2.	 If the results do not match the questionnaire the OSPO team members return to Step 6 and help the relevant department complete their work.

# Periodic Reassessment

The OSPO schedules a review of the program every 18 months to ensure it maintains conformance with OpenChain ISO/IEC 5230:2020. This also meets one of the requirements of the standard.

The OSPO also schedules a review of current company processes every six months to help ensure everything is optimized. This review is based on reports from individual project managers about how quick and effective current processes are, and which current processes are causing challenges for the teams.
